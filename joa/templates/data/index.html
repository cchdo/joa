<h2>About the Data on This Website </h2>

<p><em>J. Swift</em></p>

<p>Syd Levitus and colleagues at NOAA assembled and occasionally re-issued collections of quality-controlled mean temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and nutrients on standard level surfaces on a 1-degree positional grid for the World Ocean, known as World Ocean Atlas data files, typically abbreviated WOAyy, where yy is the two-digit year of publication, e.g., WOA98, WOA05, WOA09. These are extremely valuable and versatile statistical data compilations, though of course the combination of averaging and gridding make WOAyy data different from those from measured profiles. Here we use the multi-year all-year average WOA gridded data files. These &#39;mean ocean&#39; data were and are often used in ocean models. The WOAyy data were originally released by NOAA on a layer-by-layer basis at standard levels. To assemble JOA-compatible data files from these we picked the values at each grid point from all the levels and assembled them into vertical profiles, with data at each WOAyy standard level for which there are reported values. We provide some of the WOAyy data as areal, gridded data at the original 1-degree grid spacing, and most at a sub-grid spacing which provides adequate basin-scale visualization with reduced computer resource requirements. Collections of these grids and sub-grids from WOA98, WOA05, and WOA09 are provided here as a reference to pre-2018 knowledge of the mean ocean. The WOA18 collection is provided elsewhere on this site. We also provide vertical sections taken from WOAyy at 5-degree intervals of latitude and 10-degree intervals of longitude. IMPORTANT NOTE: In NOAA&#39;s WOAyy releases prior to 2018, the &quot;pressure&quot; field is actually depth in meters (we did not make the ≈1% adjustment, which is of little consequence for most JOA uses), and the oxygen and nutrient data are in volume units (numerically only ≈2.6% adjustment for nutrients but a factor of ≈45x for dissolved oxygen). To go from O2 in ml/l to O2 in μmol/kg multiply by 44.660 and divide by density in CGS. [There is a small issue regarding what density to use, but it gets buried in the decimal place weeds. It is best to use sigma-0, i.e. (1000 + sigma0)/1000 in CGS.] To go from nutrients in μmol/l to μmol/kg divide by density in CGS. Use sigma-0 for the nutrient conversion. See the document &quot;<a href="/static/joa/files/O2%20in%20volume%20units%20to%20O2%20in%20mass%20units.pdf">O2 in volume units to O2 in mass units.pdf</a>&quot;for instructions on how to use JOA to convert oxygen and nutrient data from volume units to mass units, required for direct comparisons with data from cruises (or the WOA18 data files) where those parameters are expressed in mass units.</p>

<p>Our largest collection in terms of sheer number of sections is ≈2200 mostly pre-WOCE (pre-1990&#39;s) vertical sections assembled from the original NODC data files contributing to SIO Professor Joseph L. Reid&#39;s World Ocean data collection. From cruises in NODC archives, and some newer cruises originally from colleagues, over more than two decades Joe sifted for the best available data from each region of the World Ocean (except for the Arctic). His intended purpose was to make maps of water properties (which he used to great effect in his many publications), not vertical sections, and so he cut off stations from a cruise where a better (better for his purposes) cruise overlapped it. He made corrections to many of the data for known offsets (mostly standard seawater batch offsets). Here we went into the NODC files and retrieved the entire cruise data set for each cruise Joe used, assembled the stations into sensible vertical sections, applied the same corrections Joe used, and then we culled many bad data values. The resulting 2200 sections represent the basic data knowledge of the deep ocean basins prior to the 1990s. The data sets all include temperature and salinity, nearly all have dissolved oxygen data, and most have nutrient (NO3, PO4, and/or SiO3) data. The data are available in JOA binary and also in an NODC text data format called &quot;SD2&quot;. NODC no longer delivers data in SD2 format, but the JOA application will import/read any of these text data files if one changes the suffix from .txt to .sd2. IMPORTANT NOTE: The oxygen and nutrient data in the Reid data collection are in volume units (numerically only ≈2.6% adjustment for nutrients but a factor of ≈45x for dissolved oxygen). To go from O2 in ml/l to O2 in μmol/kg multiply by 44.660 and divide by density in CGS. [There is a small issue regarding what density to use, but it gets buried in the decimal place weeds. It is best to use sigma-0, i.e. (1000 + sigma0)/1000 in CGS.] To go from nutrients in μmol/l to μmol/kg divide by density in CGS. Use sigma-0 for the nutrient conversion.

<p>Under &quot;Other Data Files&quot; we have a somewhat dated collection of pre-1990s sections  as Atlantic, Indian, and Pacific Pre-WOCE Basin Scale Sections, along with sections from the highly-regarded GEOSECS, TTO, and SAVE expeditions. A collection of Arctic Ocean and Nordic Sea data is also provided.</p>

<p>We also supply a special collection of data files meant to be used, chapter by chapter, with the &quot;DPO JOA Examples&quot; which accompany the Talley et al. textbook, &quot;Descriptive Physical Oceanography&quot;.  These are normally accessed from within the DPO JOA Examples, but we provide them here as an alternate source of the data sets.</p>
